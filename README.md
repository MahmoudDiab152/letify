# Litify - Online Bookstore

## Project Overview

Litify is a **frontend-only** online bookstore that provides a seamless shopping experience for book lovers. The website allows users to browse featured books, view new arrivals, add books to their cart, and securely complete purchases. The platform is designed with a user-friendly interface, ensuring easy navigation and accessibility.

> **Note:** This project is purely frontend and does not include backend functionalities like user authentication or order processing. It is inspired by and follows the structure of a tutorial from YouTube.

## Features

- **Homepage:** Displays promotional offers and highlights top-selling books.
- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to find books by entering keywords.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add books to their cart and manage their selections.
- **User Authentication (Frontend Only):** Users can register and log in, but no actual backend processing.


- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes using CSS and Swiper.js.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout (including Normalize.css for consistent rendering across browsers).
- **JavaScript:** Enhances interactivity and shopping cart functionality.
- **Swiper.js:** Provides a smooth and responsive carousel for book previews.
- **Font Awesome:** Adds icons for improved UI/UX.
